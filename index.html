        <h3>The seven wonders of the world are magnificent structures that inspire a sense of wonder. The seven wonders
            of
            the classical world astonished those that have the opportunity to have seen them in history. The New Seven
            Wonders Foundation in Switzerland did receive over 200 entries from all over the world, and twenty-one
            contestants were chosen. In Lisbon, Portugal, the complete list of the seven modern wonders was declared in
            2007. The Taj Mahal of India, China’s Great Wall, Brazil’s Christ the Redeemer statue, Peru’s Machu Picchu,
            Jordan’s Petra, Italy’s Colosseum, and Mexico’s Chichen Itza make up the latest seven modern wonders of the
            world.</h3>

    <h4><hr><hr>1. The Great Wall of China</h4>
    <td><img src="img/The Great Wall of China.png" alt=""></td>
    <td>
        <details>The Great Wall of China is the longest wall in the world! The Chinese national symbol was built by
            several
            dynasties (ruling families) over hundreds of years (nearly 1,800), starting in about 220 BC. The wall was
            built
            to defend areas from invasions and had watchtowers built on the highest places. The famous landmark is
            actually
            made up of lots of overlapping walls that measure a combined length of up to 20,000 kilometres. Millions of
            people visit the Wonder every year.</details>

    <h4><hr>2. Taj Mahal, India</h4>
    <img src="img/Taj Mahal, India.png" alt="">
    <details>This magnificent landmark took 16 years and 20,000 workers to build! It was commissioned to be built in
        1632 by Emperor Shah Jahan with the purpose of housing the tomb of his wife, Mumtaz. Architecturally, the
        building represents symmetry and balance, and the colour of the exterior marble walls change depending on the
        time of day. In the morning sun, the white marble looks a shade of pink. During the evening, it looks the colour
        of milk and looks golden at night when lit by the moon. Because the Taj Mahal commemorates Shah Jahan’s love for
        Mumtaz, couples like to have their photographs taken with the building in the background.</details>
    <h4><hr>3. Petra, Jordan</h4>
    <img src="img/Petra, Jordan.png" alt="">
    <details>Petra is an ancient city carved into rock. It is thought that it was built over 2,000 years ago by a group
        of people who lived in the Wadi Musa valley, called the Nabateans. However, not much is known about the
        Nabateans. The city fell to the Roman Empire in AD 106 and an earthquake in AD 363 damaged the city, which
        resulted in it eventually falling into disuse. The city ruins were rediscovered in 1812 by a Swiss explorer
        called Johann Burckhardt.</details>
    <h4><hr>4. The Colosseum, Italy</h4>
    <img src="img/The Colosseum, Italy.png" alt="">
    <details>The Colosseum, also known as the Flavian Amphitheatre, was built between AD 70 and AD 80. It was used for
        gladiator fights, animal hunts and public executions for four centuries. The floor could also be flooded in
        order to stage sea battles! Following the fall of the Roman Empire, the architectural masterpiece was actually
        used as a housing complex. Then, in 1349, a great earthquake destroyed parts of the structure. Despite the
        damage done over the years, it remains an incredibly popular tourist attraction today.</details>
    <h4><hr>5. Christ the Redeemer, Brazil</h4>
    <img src="img/Christ the Redeemer, Brazil.png" alt="">
    <details>Christ the Redeemer is a statue located at the summit of Corcovado Mountain overlooking Rio de Janeiro in
        Brazil. The statue shows Jesus Christ with his arms spread out over the city. The statue is 30 metres tall, with
        an arm span of the statue is 28 metres!

        The structure is the newest wonder, having been completed in 1931. At the time of its construction, Brazil was a
        predominantly Catholic country, and images of the Christ statue were spread throughout.</details>
    <h4><hr>6. Chichen Itza, Mexico</h4>
    <img src="img/Chichén Itzá, Mexico.png" alt="">
    <details>Chichen Itza was a city built by The Maya people over 1,500 years ago. The city was an important political
        and economic centre for The Maya people. You’ll find the Temple of Kukulkán (named after the serpent deity),
        sometimes also referred to as El Castillo, there. It has 91 steps on each of its four sides. An extra step was
        added at the top of the temple to total 365 steps – one for each day of the year. The top of the temple features
        a carving of Kukulkán.</details>
    <h4><hr>7. Machu Picchu, Peru</h4>
    <img src="img/Machu Picchu, Peru.png" alt="">
    <details>Machu Picchu is the ruins of a city from the Incan empire that was built in the 15th century. The ruins are
        in the Andes Mountains, over 2,000 metres above sea level. Its walls and other architectural elements are cut
        into the natural rock.

        It’s not certain why the city was first built, although some sources suggest it was used as a royal retreat for
        the emperor, Pachacuti Inca Yupanqui. It is thought to have been used between the 15th and 16th centuries, but
        was gradually abandoned over time. Today, it is a very popular tourist site, so much so that the Peruvian
        government has begun limiting the amount of people able to visit each year to preserve it.</details>
